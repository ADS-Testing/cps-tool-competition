# Sample Test Generators

To illustrate the use of the code pipeline and ease the development of new test generators we provide few examples of already implemented test generators.

### One Test Generator
This test generator (`one_test_generator.py`) generates **only** one test (see the figure below) and exits.

Its purpose is to show how tests can be created from *road points* and how to force specific shapes (e.g., straight segments) even if the *road points* are interpolated.

### Naive Random Generator
This test generators (`random_generator.py`) generates roads by sampling four points in the map between `0` and `map_size` randomly.

This test generators heavily rely on interpolation to generate the roads, it is fast, but also generates many invalid roads.

### Deep Janus Generator
This test generators (`deepjanus_seed_generator.py`) generates roads ...
