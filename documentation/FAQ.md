# Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. BeamNG does not start and I get a `socket.timeout` exception.

If you experience this problem please check if the path to the folder containing the BeamNG executables and/or the path the user folder contain any space. If so, please move the offending folder to a location without spaces in the path.

### 2. BeamNG starts but I get a `ConnectionRefusedError` exception.

You may experience this problem if you did not set properly the `--beamng-user` path to the folder you created and in which you copied the `tech.key` file.
